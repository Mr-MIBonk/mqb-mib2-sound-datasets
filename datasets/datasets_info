[LO]_DTCP_dataset — designed to protect content transmitted via IP protocol. It is not used on MIB2
[LO]_ASAM_ODX_MUX_dataset = 0x200 — unit identifier string is stored here.
[LO]_hmi_control_speed_dataset = 0x240 — responsible for disabling functions when speed thresholds are exceeded
[LO]_language_dataset = 0x280 — languages that are used by default for the interface, voice control and navigation are stored here. These languages must be present in the [LO]_visible_MMI_language_dataset (see below):
[LO]_visible_MMI_language_dataset = 0x2D00 — contains strings-identifiers of languages available for selection in the user interface language settings menu. These languages must be available in the file \tsd\hmi\HMI\config\lang_hmi_builtin.config (MIB STD2) or \mmx\eso\hmi\lsd\lang_hmi_builtin.config (MIB2 HIGH) of the installed firmware. The first byte in your data is the number of available languages:
[LO]_powermanagment_timer_dataset = 0x440 (MIB2 Entry/STD), 0x2C00 (MIB2 HIGH) — contains power management settings
[LO]_audio_parameter_sound_dataset = 0x3000 — configures basic sound processing. It depends on the number of speakers, left/right-hand drive, geometry of the interior of the car, and so on. On systems with external sound processing (e.g. Canton), it may not be available.
[LO]_DAB_frequency_dataset = 0x460 — configures digital radio reception parameters in countries with specific frequency bands
[LO]_audio_parameter_sound_announcement_dataset = 0x3600 — configures the sound processing of voice messages issued by the audio system. On systems with external sound processing (e.g. Canton), it may not be available.
[LO]_audio_management_mute_hmi_constant = 0xDA0 — contains sound mute settings on MIB2 STD and HIGH.
[LO]_audio_parameter_telephone = 0xF00 (MIB2 Entry), 0x3F00 (MIB2 STD) — sets the sound parameters of the telephone according to the type of sound processing system and the number of speakers
[LO]_audio_parameter_SDS — voice control system settings. It is not used on MIB2.
[LO]_audio_parameter_individual_sound_processing = 0x700 (MIB2 Entry/Swing2 until 2017 with firmware version 6xxx and MIB STD2), 0x7100 (MIB2 Entry/Swing2 c 2017 and MIB2 GP/Swing3 with firmware 7xxx, 8xxx) — configures additional sound processing Škoda Surround (Arkamys) and Virtual Subwoofer are included in the sound settings
[LO]_eco_HMI_dataset = 0x2F00 — configures the GreenDrive/EcoTrainer assistant algorithms according to the type of gearbox and engine power
[LO]_audio_parameter_sound_cabrio_processing — configures sound processing parameters for cars with open top/roof
[LO]_audio_parameter_sound_configuration_dataset = 0x3B00 — configures the type of sound system used (passive speakers or Canton) and its characteristics
[LO]_speech_signal_enhancement_dataset = 0x4500 — on units supporting this technology, configures additional voice processing of the voice control assistant
[LO]_in_car_communication = 0x7000 — configures the settings of the electronic voice amplifier
[LO]_air_quality — configures the control of the air cleaning system where this function is supported
