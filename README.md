# MQB MIB2 Sound Settings

Every ZDC container for MIB2 units contain several datasets describing car's sound system and equalizer finetuning for installed speakers. The most important are two sets located on 0x003B00 (Audio Sound Configuration) and 0x003000 (Audio Sound) adresses. 

This repository is meant to research the details inside sound datasets.
