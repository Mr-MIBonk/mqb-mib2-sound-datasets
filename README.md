# MQB MIB1/2/3 Sound Settings

Every ZDC container for MIB units contains several datasets that describe a car's sound system and equalizer fine-tuning for installed speakers. The most important datasets are located at the following addresses:

-   **0x003000** _(Audio Sound)_ and **0x003B00** _(Audio Sound Configuration)_ for MIB2 units
-   **0x007201** and 0x007204 for MIB3 units
-   **0x001000** for MIB1 cars, which have a unified dataset.

This repository is intended to research the details of these datasets. The results have been published at the following [article](https://mqb-blog.com/en/2022/02/21/sound-dataset/).
